GeoMap build-out

Assigned geographic roles to country_cd ▸ Country/Region, state ▸ State/Province, county ▸ County, zip_code ▸ ZIP Code, city ▸ City.

Built a 5-level hierarchy Country ► State ► County ► ZIP ► City for drill-down.

Created the initial filled-map view at State level, added SUM(Case Count) to Colour, and enabled + expansion to counties/ZIPs.

Filtered to USA only, turned off land-cover layers, and customised tooltips to show location + case count.

Published the sheet to the dashboard container and verified drill-through performance on ~40 K ZIP marks.



2. Queues ↔ Roles interactive view

Built a Queue ► Role hierarchy to support native drill-down.

Added a View Level parameter (Queue, Role) and Boolean “Show Sheet” calcs to control sheet swapping.

Configured Change-Parameter actions so a click on a Queue bar flips to the Role view (pre-filtered to that queue) and vice-versa.

De-duped role names, applied consistent colour palette, and documented the action-flow in the workbook for future admins.



3. LOBD ID research & flow update

Cross-checked LOBD_ID across DataSource_A (Case master) and DataSource_B (BOS feed).

Located Case ID ↔ LOBD Name relationship in the BOS _LOB_DETAIL column, confirmed 1:1 mapping for 98 % of records.

Added a left join in the staging prep-flow (case_id key) and validated row counts & duplicates post-join.

Once QA passes, this branch will be merged into the Main Enterprise Open Inventory prep-flow and scheduled with existing credentials.
