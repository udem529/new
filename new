Problems:

Network Disruption:

Providers (e.g., UCLA) are leaving the network, forcing members to reconsider their doctor choices and care continuity.
Out-of-Network Coverage Concerns:

High out-of-network costs with significant co-insurance (e.g., 40%) and elevated out-of-pocket maximums create financial uncertainty.
Members face confusion over coverage differences between HMO and PPO plans regarding out-of-network services.
Communication & Decision Support:

Insufficient advance notice and clarity on network changes and alternative in-network options lead to member uncertainty.
Complex information on cost structures and benefits makes it hard for members to make informed decisions.
Fixes:

Proactive Network Communication:

Notify members in advance about network changes and potential impacts on their care.
Clearly communicate available continuity of care options if a provider is affected.
Enhanced Provider Tools:

Upgrade the provider directory to help members quickly find in-network alternatives near them.
Integrate cost calculators to display in-network versus out-of-network expenses.
Clear Benefit Differentiation:

Simplify and standardize explanations of HMO vs. PPO benefits, especially highlighting out-of-network cost implications.
Provide clear guidance on co-insurance and out-of-pocket maximums across different services.
Recommendations:

Develop a Proactive Outreach Strategy:

Use predictive analytics to identify members likely affected by network changes and offer personalized guidance.
Implement targeted communication campaigns explaining upcoming network adjustments and available support.
Improve Agent Training & Support Materials:

Train agents to explain complex benefit details, including out-of-network costs and coverage differences, more effectively.
Equip agents with decision support tools that simplify the explanation of network changes and cost implications.
Enhance Digital Resources:

Create easy-to-navigate online tools and FAQs that detail in-network vs. out-of-network benefits, premium differences, and cost expectations.
Develop mobile app features for real-time provider searches and cost comparisons to empower members in decision-making.

Plan Options & Benefits:

Issue: Confusion between Medicare Advantage vs. Medicare Supplement (Plan G vs. Plan G Extra).
Fix: Provide a clear side-by-side comparison chart outlining key benefits and differences.
Premium Concerns:

Fix: Explain that premiums reflect administrative costs, benefit usage, and risk pool factors. Offer a cost/benefit analysis.
Network Status & Out-of-Network Coverage:

Issue: Change in assigned primary care physician (e.g., UCLA) creates confusion regarding in-network vs. out-of-network care.
Fix:
Provide an updated in-network provider list.
Clarify out-of-network costs and coverage details.
Advise on steps to select a new PCP if preferred, and inform that the current plan is valid until year-end.
