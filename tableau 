To calculate the percentage of cases closed within one day, based on:

Case Status = "Closed"

Received Date and Closed Date available


Here's how you can break it down:


---

Step-by-Step Logic

1. Filter only closed cases
CASE WHEN [Case Status] = 'Closed' THEN ...


2. Calculate the duration between Received Date and Closed Date
DATEDIFF('day', [Received Date], [Closed Date])


3. Count cases where the difference is â‰¤ 1 day


4. Divide by total closed cases and multiply by 100 to get percentage

Pseudocode / Calculated Field Example (e.g., in Tableau or similar BI tool)

-- For the count of cases closed within 1 day
IF [Case Status] = 'Closed' AND DATEDIFF('day', [Received Date], [Closed Date]) <= 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END

Then for the percentage:

SUM(IF [Case Status] = 'Closed' AND DATEDIFF('day', [Received Date], [Closed Date]) <= 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
/
SUM(IF [Case Status] = 'Closed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
* 100
